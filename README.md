# Football-Manager

A basic football manager application which helps me manage my weekly football lsit, through sorting and correcting venue details, 
Its only useful currently for the text format of a current weekly football I manage, but i plan to build it into a general application which can handle different formats.
I do also plan to add things by making it more realistic and dynamic through OOP by creating players, marking things like attendance, performance, peronal details, payemnts etc.

DISCLAIMER: I am doing this purely for the sake of personal interests.
